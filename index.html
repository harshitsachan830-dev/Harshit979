        <i>Himachal Pradesh is a northern Indian state in the Himalayas, known as "Dev Bhumi" (Abode of Gods) and for
            its
            scenic mountain landscapes, including Shimla and Manali. It became a full state on January 25, 1971, and has
            Shimla as its summer capital and Dharamshala as the winter capital. The state is rich in culture, with
            strong
            Tibetan influences, and offers various adventure sports like trekking and paragliding, attracting tourists
            year-roundThe predominantly mountainous region comprising the present-day Himachal Pradesh has been
            inhabited since pre-historic times, having witnessed multiple waves of human migrations from other
            areas.[14] Through its history, the region was mostly ruled by local kingdoms, some of which accepted the
            suzerainty of larger empires. Prior to India's independence from the British, Himachal comprised the hilly
            regions of the Punjab Province of British India. After independence, many of the hilly territories were
            organised as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh, which later became a Union Territory. In
            1966, hilly areas of the neighbouring Punjab state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted
            full statehood in 1971.

            Himachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. Agriculture,
            horticulture, hydropower,.</i>

    <b>Madhya Pradesh is a central Indian state, the second-largest by area, known as the "Heart of India" for its
        location and rich heritage, diverse landscapes, and significant biodiversity. The state boasts three UNESCO
        World Heritage sites—Khajuraho, Sanchi, and Bhimbetka—and is a leading habitat for tigers, earning it the title
        "Tiger State of India". Its economy relies on agriculture, minerals, and industries, while its capital is

        over 72 million residents. It borders the states of Rajasthan to the northwest, Uttar Pradesh to the northeast,
        Chhattisgarh to the east, Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat to the west.[11]

        The area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area of the ancient Avanti Mahajanapada, whose
        capital Ujjain (also known as Avantika) arose as a major city during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in
        the sixth century BCE. Subsequently, the region was ruled by the major dynasties of India. The Maratha Empire
        dominated the majority of the 18th century. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War in the 19th century, the region
        was divided into several princely states under the British and incorporated into Central Provinces and Berar and

        and Jiwajirao Scindia as Rajpramukh (Governor). In 1956, these states were reorganised and its parts were
